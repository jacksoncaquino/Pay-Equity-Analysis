Performing pay equity analysis on a fictitious dataset using Python on a Jupyter Notebook.

It uses Chi-square, regressions, median calculations, and modeling to find compensation discrimination issues, determine if they are statistically significant, and then propose a solution, along with the budget needed to fix the issue.
